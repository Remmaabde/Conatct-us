## 🤝 Collaboration Process

We worked together using **GitHub** and collaborated on separate branches.

### Branches Used
- `reem-styling` — Reem’s branch for HTML and CSS layout/design
- `robel-js-validation` — Robel’s branch for adding interactivity using JavaScript

### Merge Conflict & Resolution

We encountered a merge conflict when combining both branches into `main`. The conflict occurred because both HTML and JS were being updated at the same time in the same file.

#### ✅ Steps We Took to Resolve It:
1. Pulled the latest version of `main` into both branches:
   ```bash
   git checkout styling
   git pull origin main
